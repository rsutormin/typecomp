KBase Type Compiler
===================

The KBase Type Compiler consumes a type-document and produces a
server and implementation libraries in one language and client
libraries in multiple supported languages.

Usage
-----

This module generates two executables to compile specification
documents into client/server libraries:

* compile\_typespec
* compile\_dbd\_to\_typespec

Run these commands with no arguments for usage information.

Development
-----------

**Do not modify** the following files directly, as they are
automatically generated by Parse::Yapp based on the corresponding
yp file in the top level of the repository:

* lib/Bio/KBase/KIDL/erdoc.pm
* lib/Bio/KBase/KIDL/typedoc.pm

To recompile the grammars, run "make".
